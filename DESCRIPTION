Description: This experimental in-development package provides a set of functions 
    to develop data analysis code that systematically documents researcher degrees 
    of freedom when conducting analyses on observational data. 
    The resulting code base is self-documenting, supports unit testing and power
    simulations based on simulated data. The documented researcher degrees of 
    freedom can be exhausted to generate a distribution of outcome estimates.
