\title{Define Your Research Design and Create Code Directory with Step Templates}
\usage{
define_design(
  steps,
  rel_dir = "./code",
  one_file = FALSE,
  one_file_name = "design_steps.R"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{steps}{A character vector containing the names for the step functions.
All members need to be valid R names.}

\item{rel_dir}{A relative path to a directory in which you want to create
the step templates.}

\item{one_file}{If \code{TRUE}, then all templates will be stored in a file
with the name \code{one_file_name}. If {FALSE} (the default), each step template
will be stored in a separate file with the step name acting as file name.}

\item{one_file_name}{The name of the code file conating the step templates if
all step templates are stored in one file. Defaults to "design_steps.R".}
}
\value{
The \code{steps} parameter.
}
\description{
This generates a directory at \code{rel_dir}
(defaulting to "./code"). In this directory it will create
a set of files with templates for all code steps or a joint file
containing all step templates.
