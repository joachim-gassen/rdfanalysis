\title{Exhaust all Researcher Degrees of Freedom}
\usage{
exhaust_design(
  d,
  start_input,
  weight = FALSE,
  est_by_cchoice = 10,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A character vector of the research design steps function names.}

\item{start_input}{The input data for the first step.}

\item{weight}{Whether each step's choices should be weighted by their user assigned weights as
included in the \code{choice_type}. Protocols with zero weight are excluded from the analysis.
Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{est_by_cchoice}{Each continous choice will be evaluated by \code{est_by_choice} equally
spaced steps, staring at \code{valid_min} and ending at \code{valid_max}.}

\item{verbose}{Set to \code{TRUE} for some additional diagnostic output.
Useful for large designs that take a while to process.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing results for all feasible choice permutations.
}
\description{
Parse through a research design, iterating over all possible choices, thereby exhausting all
documented researcher degrees of freedom. Returns a data frame containing the results for all
choice combinations.
