\arguments{
\item{ests}{The data frame provided by \code{\link[rdfanalysis:exhaust_design]{exhaust_design()}}.}

\item{spec_curve_parms}{A list containing additional paramters that will be
passed on to \code{\link[rdfanalysis:plot_rdf_spec_curve]{plot_rdf_spec_curve()}}.}

\item{design}{if not \code{NULL} it takes the design that was used to generate
the estimates. In this case, you also need to specify the \code{rel_dir}
and \code{start_input} parameter below. The shiny app will then display
full regresssion results when you select choices that generate less than
\code{regression_cutoff} estimates.}

\item{rel_dir}{The path to the code directory. See above.}

\item{start_input}{The parameters that you pass to the first design step.
See above.}

\item{libs}{A vector containing additional packages that need to be attached
to run the design. NOTE: While this works fine when you host the shiny app
yourself, shinyapps.io fails to include the listed packages when deploying
the app. So, if you plan to host your app on shinyapps.io, you are better
served including \code{library()} calls in your design code files or to use
the \code{::} operator in your code.}

\item{add_files}{A character vector containing relative paths to files and
dreictories that you want to bundle with the shiny app. The files will be
copied to the temporary directory that hosts the shiny app and directories
will be copied recursively.}

\item{regression_cutoff}{If your choices generate less or equal estimates,
the display will switch to normal regression output (needs parameters above
to be not \code{NULL}).}

\item{default_choices}{A list containing choices that you want
the app to start with. If \code{NULL}, it will start with all choices
included.}

\item{title}{The title of the shiny app.}

\item{abstract}{Text that will be displayed by the app. Wrapped
into \code{HTML()} so that you can use HTML code.}

\item{choice_labels}{Character vector containing the labels that will be used
to label the select list input controls in the shiny app. If \code{NULL},
the select list input controls are labeled based on the choice column names
from the \code{ests} data frame.}
